# Data Structures

Simple data structures written in C. Primarily intended for my hobby operating system but can easily be adapted for other uses (since there are no dependencies on any other library, apart from the testing code).

Run `make test` in the main directory to build and run the tests. Otherwise the makefile will produce `libds.a` in the build directory.
